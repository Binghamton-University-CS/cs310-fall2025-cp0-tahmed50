Please type or copy the CS 310 honesty statement here:

These instructions turn a github repository directory on the CS machines into a single .tar.gz file with the correct format and naming conventions for submission to Brightspace. We use scripts to unpack, test, and grade your submission; if your file is not named and formatted like all the other students' files, the scripts can break and cause significant inconvenience. To incentivize attention to detail, a few penalty points may be taken off for incorrect naming and submission structures. These instructions are for CP0; for subsequent assignments, replace CP0 with CP1, CP2, etc.
